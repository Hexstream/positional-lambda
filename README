Project's home: https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/positional-lambda/


positional-lambda is a concise, intuitive and flexible syntax (macro)
for trivial lambdas that eschews explicit (and often
contextually-redundant) naming of parameter variables in favor of
positional references, with support for a used or ignored &rest
parameter and automatic declaration of ignored parameters when logical
"gaps" are left in the positional references. Further convenience
features are provided.
